# Errata for "Matrix Product Belief Propagation for reweighted stochastic dynamics over graphs"
Stefano Crotti, Alfredo Braunstein

The article is found at https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307935120.

1. At page 5, below equation 12, the text says $p(m)$ has a minimum at $m\approx 0.145$. It should be either $p(m)$ has a maximum at $m\approx 0.145$ or $g(m)$ has a minimum  at $m\approx 0.145$.
2. In section 1 of the supplementary information, equations S1, S2, S3, S5, and S7 have a minus sign after $\exp\left \\{ \right .$, which should not be there.
